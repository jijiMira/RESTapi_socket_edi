# RESTapi_socket_edi
 The project is a Node.js application using Express to create a REST API and Socket.io for real-time communication. Here's a brief description:  Description: The project is a Node.js application with two main modules, app.js and cli.js. The app.js module uses Express to create a REST API server interacting with a PostgreSQL database through the pg module. It exposes endpoints for adding orders, searching orders by ID, and generating EDIFACT messages. The server also utilizes Socket.io to enable real-time communication with connected clients. The cli.js file is a client using Axios and Socket.io-client to interact with the server, extract information from EDIFACT messages, store them in a JSON file, and make HTTP requests.  Key Features:  Creation of an order via a POST request using Express and storage in a PostgreSQL database. Search for an order by ID through a GET request. Generation of an EDIFACT message from order data. Real-time communication with clients via Socket.io. A command-line client (cli.js) that extracts data from EDIFACT messages, stores them in a JSON file, and makes HTTP requests. Structure:  The Express server uses two ports, 3000 for the REST API and 3001 for the Socket.io server. The cli.js file uses Axios to perform a GET request to the API endpoint specified in the apiUrl variable.
